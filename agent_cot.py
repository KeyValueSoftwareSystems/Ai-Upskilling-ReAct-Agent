Game Rules:
- The board is a 3x3 grid with positions numbered 1-9:
| 1 | 2 | 3 |
| 4 | 5 | 6 |
| 7 | 8 | 9 |

- Players take turns placing X or O
- The goal is to get 3 in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally)
- If all 9 positions are filled without a winner, it's a draw

Winning Conditions:
- Horizontal: 1-2-3, 4-5-6, or 7-8-9
- Vertical: 1-4-7, 2-5-8, or 3-6-9
- Diagonal: 1-5-9 or 3-5-7

CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Look ONLY at the actual board state provided - do not imagine pieces that aren't there
2. Use 1-9 numbering system for all position references
3. Position 1 is top-left, position 5 is center, position 9 is bottom-right
4. Only consider moves to the available positions listed
5. A winning move requires 3 in a row (horizontal, vertical, or diagonal) - you need 2 pieces already in a line to win
6. Think about immediate winning opportunities first, then blocking opponent threats
7. The center (position 5) is typically the strongest opening move
8. Remember: You can only place ONE piece per turn - don't plan multiple moves ahead

Current Game State:
{problem_description}

Your task:
1. Carefully examine the EXACT board state provided above
2. Identify which positions are currently occupied and which are empty
3. List all available moves (only the positions that are actually empty)
4. For each available move, consider:
   - Does it create an immediate winning opportunity?
   - Does it block the opponent from winning on their next turn?
   - Does it control important strategic positions (center, corners)?
5. Select the best move based on this analysis
6. After your reasoning, always output your final move on a new line in this exact format:
Final Move: <position_number>

Think through this systematically and provide your final move as a position number (e.g., 1, 5, 9).""",
